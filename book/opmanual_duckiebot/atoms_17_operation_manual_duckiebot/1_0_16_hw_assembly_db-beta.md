# Assembling the `DB-beta` Duckiebot {#assembling-duckiebot-db-beta status=ready}

This page is for the `DB-beta` configuration used in the AMoD class at ETH Zurich in 2020. The hardware used in this Duckiebot model is very similar to the hardware of the `DB19`. The major difference between these models is the replacement of the Raspberry Pi 3 by a Jetson Nano Nvidia board which lead to other minor hardware changes like a new camera, a cooling fan, layout, etc.

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Be enrolled in ETHZâ€™s AMoD 2020 course and have picked up your Duckiebox from the Autolab.

Requires: Time: about 1-1.5 hours (45 minutes for an experienced Duckiebot builder).

Results: An assembled Duckiebot in configuration `DB-beta`.

## Foreword:
Important assembly considerations:
- Never assemble the Duckiebot on a metal surface. The pins on the bottom of the board are conductive, and might short. The Duckiebot will be very sad (fried duck).
- Do NOT connect the battery cables to the Jetson Nano board or the hut until the very end. Doing it too early has the potential of causing irreparable damage to the Duckiebot (physically and mentally). 
- All electrical components (Jetson Nano, Board, Hut)  should ALWAYS be connected with nylon screws and nuts.

## Installing the motors

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: 
- 4x Long metal screws (longest in the box)
- 2x Motor cables
- 2x Blue motors
- 4x M3 nuts (the only size available for metal nuts)
- 1x Bottom plate
- 4x motor mounts (Note, the motors mounts that come with the bottom plate have very tight tolerancing. For easier installation, use the additional motor mounts that come in the same bag with one of the motors).
